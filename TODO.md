# Todo

## Urgent
* Nothing much here...


## Required stuff
1.) Make a simple site with skeleton template. DONE

2.) Make simple models for users and posts. DONE

    * Use Python classes for this.

3.) Initialise the database and its migrations, allowing for models to interact. DONE

    * Use sqlalchemy for this.

    * Use two tables, one for the user and the other for the posts.

4.) Allow users to post and make entries to the database. DONE

5.) Allow users to comment on posts. DONE
    * Nonononononononono, just make the comments a column on the posts table.

6.) Expand on options for users later.
    * I am adding the option to vote, works with the same algorithm used on Reddit, except for this small change...
    * ((upvotes - downvotes) / time) * importance
    * I will explain what this importance variable does soon, after revision, but basically its like a temporary sticky post.


## Extension stuff
7.) Allow for images and videos.

8.) Make pms/chat possible.
